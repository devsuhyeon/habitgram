- This is a first project using `React`

# ✨ Background

Most of the existing habit tracking platforms were created for personal use. A few habit tracker platforms can share habits with others but lack communication capabilities. Therefore, I decided to develop a community-based habit tracking website that allows users to motivate each other to perform better and keep them moving towards goals.
